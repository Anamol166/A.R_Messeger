📱 A.R Messenger
A simple and beginner-friendly real-time chat application built with Android (Java) and Firebase.
This is my first Android app, so it may not be perfect, but I built it with the goal of learning real-time messaging, notifications, and Firebase integration. The UI is simple, clean, and easy to understand, making this project a great reference for beginners who want to build their own messaging app.
